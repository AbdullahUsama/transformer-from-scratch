# 🧠 Transformer From Scratch (PyTorch)

This repository contains my **from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture**, as described in the paper:

> [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) – Vaswani et al. (2017)


I built this project to deeply understand how Transformers work under the hood, following both the original paper and selected online tutorials (listed below).

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Multi-Head Self-Attention
- ✅ Positional Encoding
- ✅ Layer Normalization
- ✅ Encoder & Decoder blocks
- ✅ Scaled Dot-Product Attention
- ✅ Masking (padding & look-ahead)
- ✅ Feed-Forward Networks

## 📘 Learning Resources I Used

To understand the architecture and its components, I referenced:

- The original paper: [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- Online tutorials and blog posts such as:
  - `The Annotated Transformer` by Harvard NLP
  - Blog posts/videos by `Jay Alammar`, `Sebastian Raschka`, and others
  - PyTorch source code and documentation
